## 👋 Introduction

**R2C** is my very first project that I’ve ever officially published — and I couldn't be more excited to share it with the world! 🎉

Built with 💻 **Electron**, this desktop companion app is more than just a code experiment. It's a personal milestone, representing the transition from tinkering with ideas to actually launching something real and usable. Whether you're a developer curious about desktop apps or someone who just enjoys digital companions, **R2C** was made with heart, a lot of learning, and plenty of late-night debugging sessions. 🌙

While it's not perfect, I’m proud to finally share it. I hope this project of mine brings you at least a of personality and fun going through your desktop! just like it did to mine! 



## 🧸 Features

- 🧍 Customizeable Characters — Add a name, timer, and dialogues to personalize your companion.

- 💬 Dynamic Dialogue Display — Characters speak at set intervals with stylized popups.

- 🖼️ Optional Visuals — Upload image assets to make your character visually come alive.

- 💻 Desktop Integration — Lightweight and always-on-top windows, perfect for background interaction.

- 🔁 Looping continuously — it gives off the feel of a reactive presence.

2. **Fill in the Character Info**
   - 🏷️ **Character Name**: Give your companion a name.
   - 💬 **Dialogues**: Write one dialogue per line. These lines will appear randomly on a loop.
   - ⏱️ **Timer**: Set how frequently your character speaks (in minutes and seconds).
   - 🖼️ **Upload Image** (optional): Add a visual to give your character a face.

   > ⚙️ *Note: The character setup form is still pretty basic — improvements to layout and UX are planned in future updates!*
